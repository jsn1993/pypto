"""Distributed system-level op DSL wrappers (``pld.<op>``).

System-level ops cover cross-rank synchronization and runtime queries.
Currently exposes :func:`world_size`; N6 will add ``notify`` / ``wait``
(``pld.system.notify`` / ``pld.system.wait``) here as well.

* ``world_size`` — host-only scalar returning the number of devices in the
  current distributed execution. Returns a :class:`Scalar` wrapping an
  :class:`ir.Expr` of type ``ScalarType(INT64)``. Codegen later lowers each
  call site to ``len(contexts)``.

Typical use sites for ``world_size``:

* loop bounds: ``for r in pl.range(pld.world_size()): ...``
* allocation sizes (in bytes): ``pld.alloc_window_buffer(pld.world_size() * 4)``
* per-rank tensor shapes: ``pld.window(buf, [pld.world_size()], dtype=pl.INT32)``

    Parser context (host-only, not inside a nested device-side scope) is
    validated by the parser before this wrapper is invoked. The DSL-side
    return wrapping lets call sites compose naturally with Python operators
    (``pld.world_size() * 4``, ``pl.range(pld.world_size())``), which the
    parser's ``invoke_dsl`` unwraps back to the underlying Call.
